tutorial_supply_3 = When there are not enough supply sources available in a territory, units will suffer from low supply and combat penalties.||Units on low supply are marked with yellow, orange or red dots depending on the severity of the shortage.
tutorial_river_penalty_title = River Crossing
tutorial_river_penalty = When sitting on a river hex a unit is highly vulnerable to attack. Crossing rivers near a strong enemy presence should be avoided, making them effective natural barriers.||Bridges can be used to cross a river quickly, provided they are not guarded by the enemy.

loading_tip_4 = Aircraft armed with torpedoes are most effective against large ships such as Battleships and Carriers, while the more accurate (dive) bombers generally perform better against small naval targets.
loading_tip_5 = Radar Stations can detect enemy air units deep into the Fog of War. However they cannot reveal the type of the enemy units, only their positions.
loading_tip_6 = Close range fire from Destroyers does more damage to coastal targets while bombardment from Cruisers and Battleships is most effective at crippling enemy efficiency.
loading_tip_7 = Commandos are specialised harassment units: They can only be spotted by adjacent infantry, and can attack targets without taking any damage in return.
loading_tip_8 = Using your strike aircraft as scouts may reveal enemy carriers more quickly but will leave them dispersed and on lower fuel, thus weakening their ability to engage the target.
loading_tip_9 = Floatplanes and flying boats are cheap and do not require refuelling. These units are ideal for scouting wide areas and can be repaired from Cruiser class units.
loading_tip_10 = Cruisers and Battleships can use their special Anti-Air ability to target enemy aircraft within their firing range. This makes them effective escorting vessels.
loading_tip_11 = Tactical Bombers equipped with bombs deal damage to any units their target is carrying in its cargo space, while torpedo armed aircraft do not.
loading_tip_12 = By holding down the <CTRL> key, you can assign long distance destinations for units. The unit will then automatically move toward this position over the following turns.
